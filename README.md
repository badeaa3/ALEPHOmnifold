In the `omnifold` folder the current analysis notebooks are listed below.
- `OmniFold Demo ALEPH Open Data Linear Thrust.ipynb` - unifold applied to thrust
- `OmniFold Demo ALEPH Open Data Log Thrust.ipynb` - unifold applied to log(1-thrust)
- `IBU Study.ipynb` - demo of iterative bayesian unfolding
- `OmniFold Demo ALEPH Open Data-2005030-badeaBranch-CutStudies.ipynb` - percentage of events/tracks passing event/track selections by year
- `Study of Events Not Passing Event Selection.ipynb` - plots showing distributions of events not passing event selections
- `Detector Level Distribution Studies.ipynb` - plots showing thrust and log(1-thrust) for each year compared to the 1994 MC


Notes:
- On January 16, 2022 Anthony ran the Linear and Log Thrust notebooks from his computer with the ALEPH data downloaded locally. The datasets are stored on MIT machines and can be moved to a better machine as desired. The path to the data is hardcoded in the notebooks so they must be updated.
